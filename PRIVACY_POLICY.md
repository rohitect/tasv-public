## Introduction

TASV ("The Advanced Smart Vault") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile application handles your information.

## Information We Access

### Device Media Access
TASV is a gallery and vault application that requires access to your device's photos, videos, and media files to function. We access:

- **Photos and Images:** To display and manage your photo library
- **Videos:** To display and play your video files
- **Media Location Data:** To read EXIF GPS data embedded in your photos for location-based organization and map view features

### Local Storage
We store the following data locally on your device:
- **App Preferences:** Your settings and preferences within the app
- **Favorites:** List of media items you've marked as favorites
- **Ratings:** Any ratings you assign to your media
- **Custom Albums:** Albums you create to organize your media
- **Vault Data:** Encrypted vault contents, vault PINs (hashed), folder structures, and access logs
- **Biometric Settings:** Your preference for biometric unlock (fingerprint/face)

### Vault Feature
TASV includes a secure vault feature that allows you to:
- Create multiple password-protected vaults
- Organize vault contents into folders
- Move photos and videos to secure storage
- Track access logs for security monitoring

All vault data is stored locally on your device with PIN protection. Vault PINs are stored as hashed values and cannot be recovered if forgotten.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

TASV is designed with privacy as a priority:

- **No Data Collection:** We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers
- **No Analytics:** We do not use third-party analytics services
- **No Advertising:** We do not display advertisements or share data with advertisers
- **No Account Required:** We do not require you to create an account or provide personal information
- **No Cloud Sync:** Your media, vault contents, and preferences remain on your device only
- **No Backup to Cloud:** Vault contents are never uploaded to any cloud service

## Permissions Used

The app requires the following permissions:

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| READ_MEDIA_IMAGES | Access photos in your gallery |
| READ_MEDIA_VIDEO | Access videos in your gallery |
| READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE | Access media on older Android versions (API < 33) |

| ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION | Show your current location on the map view |

## Data Security

All your data remains on your device:
- Media files are accessed directly from your device storage
- Vault contents are stored in the app's private directory
- Vault PINs are hashed before storage (cannot be reversed)
- Preferences are stored locally using secure storage mechanisms
- No data is transmitted over the internet
- Biometric authentication uses your device's secure hardware

## Vault Security

The vault feature provides:
- PIN-protected access to each vault (4-6 digit PIN)
- Optional biometric unlock
- Access logging for security auditing
- Automatic log retention management
- Secure file storage in app-private directories

**Important:** If you forget your vault PIN, there is no way to recover it. The vault contents would be inaccessible.

## Third-Party Services

TASV does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. Map features use OpenStreetMap tiles which may log standard web request data (IP address) on their servers.

## Children's Privacy

TASV does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age. The app simply provides access to media already stored on the device.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete from our systems. All your data remains under your control on your device.

To delete all app data including vault contents:
1. Uninstall the app, or
2. Clear app data from your device settings
